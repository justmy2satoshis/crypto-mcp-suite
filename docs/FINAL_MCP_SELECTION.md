### Cost Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 1: Start with Free Tiers**
- All 25 MCPs can run on free tiers during development
- Cost: $0/month
- Limitations: Rate limits, reduced features
- Suitable for: MVP, testing, <100 users

**Strategy 2: Tier S Only (Core Trading)**
- Deploy only Tier S MCPs (10 MCPs)
- Use Alchemy free tier (100k req/day, sufficient for <1k users)
- Cost: $0/month
- Suitable for: Small teams, <1k users

**Strategy 3: Tier S + Selective Tier A**
- Deploy Tier S (10 MCPs) + high-value Tier A (aave-mcp, etf-flow-mcp, wallet-inspector-mcp)
- Cost: $199/month (Alchemy Growth only)
- Suitable for: Mid-sized deployments, 1k-10k users

**Strategy 4: Full Production (All 25 MCPs)**
- Deploy all 25 MCPs with paid API tiers
- Cost: $1,223/month
- Suitable for: Institutional clients, 10k+ users, high-frequency trading

**Recommendation**: Start with **Strategy 2** (Tier S only, free tier) for MVP, then upgrade to **Strategy 4** (full production) based on user demand.

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Status |
|------|----------|------------|--------|
| **API Rate Limits** | MEDIUM | Redis caching (60-80% hit rate), queue system | ✅ Mitigated |
| **API Downtime** | MEDIUM | Fallback providers, health checks, circuit breakers | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Database Scaling** | LOW | TimescaleDB compression, retention policies | ✅ Mitigated |
| **MCP Version Drift** | MEDIUM | Automated dependency updates, CI/CD testing | ⚠️ Monitoring required |
| **Cost Overruns** | LOW | Free tiers for development, quotas per user | ✅ Mitigated |

### Dependency Risks

| Dependency | Risk Level | Failure Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|----------------|------------|
| **Santiment API** (crypto-sentiment-mcp) | MEDIUM | Loss of sentiment data | Fallback to LunarCrush (free) |
| **Whale Alert API** (whale-tracker-mcp) | MEDIUM | Loss of whale tracking | Fallback to on-chain scanning (slow) |
| **Dune Analytics API** (memecoin-radar-mcp, nft-analytics-mcp) | HIGH | Loss of memecoin/NFT data | No direct fallback, critical for Tier A |
| **Alchemy/Infura RPC** (uniswap-trader-mcp, aave-mcp) | HIGH | Loss of EVM trading | Multiple RPC fallbacks (QuickNode, public) |
| **Helius RPC** (jupiter-mcp) | MEDIUM | Loss of Solana trading | Fallback to public RPC (rate-limited) |
| **LiFi SDK** (bridge-rates-mcp) | LOW | Loss of bridge routing | Fallback to individual bridge APIs |

**High-Risk Dependencies**: Dune Analytics API (no fallback), Alchemy/Infura RPC (critical for trading)
**Mitigation**: Multi-provider fallbacks for RPC, caching for Dune queries
